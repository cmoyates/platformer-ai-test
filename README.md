# Platformer AI Test

This is a test project I've put together to let others try interacting with an AI for a game I'm working on.

The behavior is supposed to resemble that of the lizards from [Rain World](https://store.steampowered.com/app/312520/Rain_World/). However, I have never played Rain World, so I'm just kind of guessing. In the game this AI will control a creature that hunts down the player.

## TODO
